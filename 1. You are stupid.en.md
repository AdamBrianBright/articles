# You are stupid. Embrace it.

## You are stupid

Stop pretending you're not. **We all stupid**. We make mistakes, we forgor things, we misuse tools, we believe lies.
Just accept it, acknowledge it, admit it. We are stupid, so

## Embrace stupidity

Now that you know that you are stupid, act like one. Write code like a _dum dum_ for another _dum dum_ to read it,
because this _dum dum_ will be you in an hour, day, week, months or years to come.

**Do not assume** you will understand your code, you won't. Well, at least not immediately. It will take time, a lot of
it, so much that you forgor what you understood in the beginning.

```python
def format(n, *, b=1024, p='', s='B'):
    if not n:
        return f'0{s}'
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError(f'Invalid num type = {type(n)}')
    if not isinstance(b, int):
        raise TypeError(f'Invalid base type = {type(b)}')
    x = '-' if n < 0 else ''
    n = abs(n)
    try:
        m = int(math.floor(math.log(n, b)))
    except OverflowError:
        m = 99
    val = float(n / math.pow(b, m))
    if m > 7:
        val = f'{val:.0f}' if val.is_integer() else f'{val:.1f}'
        return f'{x}{val}{"Y"}{p}{s}'
    val = f'{val:.0f}' if val.is_integer() else f'{val:3.1f}'
    return f'{x}{val}{["", "K", "M", "G", "T", "P", "E", "Z"][m]}{p}{s}'
```

This is bad idea, no _dum dum_ will understand, we need to rewrite it.

- **Choose meaningful names**: what does it format? what the variables hold?
- **Add types** _(if your language is not strictly typed)_.
- **Add comments**, but **don't overdo** it. We are stupid, we forget to change comments, we lie in comments. If you
  can, avoid comments, but know that you are stupid.

```python
def format_amount(num: int, *, base: int = 1024, prefix: str = '', suffix: str = 'B') -> str:
    """
    Humanize any amount to string
    format_amount(0) == "0B"
    format_amount(1750) == "1.7KB"
    format_amount(1234567890) == "1.1GB"
    format_amount(2000, base=10, suffix='r') == "2Gr"
  
    :param num: numeric amount
    :param base: how much does the step takes (default 1024 as for bytes)
    :param prefix: type prefix (default '')
    :param suffix: type suffix (default B as for bytes)
    :return: Formatted amount string
    :raise TypeError:
    """
    if not num:
        return f'0{suffix}'

    if not isinstance(num, int):
        raise TypeError(f'Invalid num type = {type(num)}')

    if not isinstance(base, int):
        raise TypeError(f'Invalid base type = {type(base)}')

    sign = '-' if num < 0 else ''
    num = abs(num)

    try:
        magnitude = int(math.floor(math.log(num, base)))
    except OverflowError:
        magnitude = 99
    val = float(num / math.pow(base, magnitude))

    if magnitude > 7:
        val = f'{val:.0f}' if val.is_integer() else f'{val:.1f}'
        return f'{sign}{val}{"Y"}{prefix}{suffix}'

    val = f'{val:.0f}' if val.is_integer() else f'{val:3.1f}'
    return f'{sign}{val}{["", "K", "M", "G", "T", "P", "E", "Z"][magnitude]}{prefix}{suffix}'
```

Now I can see what's goin on from the first glance ever years after.

## Do not optimize, do not refactor

**You are stupid**. You **can't** optimize, you **can't** write perfect code. Be stupid and just write what you have to.

_Feels like code is slow?_ Don't care, just write it.
_You think there should be an abstraction?_ No you don't. You are stupid.

Evolved monkeys are very very bad at estimates.

- **We can't estimate** how long the task will take
- **We can't estimate** how performat the code is
- **We can't estimate** when abstractions are necessary
- **We can't predict** how a project will turn.

**Do not force it**. Do not rush it. Make it _"Just Worksâ„¢"_. Once you done, you are stupid. Forget optimization, forget
refactoring. Make sure you understand what you've done and make sure you will understand it later.

Done? Now is the time to optim.. **NO!** You are stupid. Write test. Please, do it. Right now. You did? **Commit** the
damn thing.

Once you've done writing _stupid code_ for _stupid people_ that runs the _stupid business_, once you **covered** it with
**tests**, you can finally optimize and refactor it. But it doesn't mean you should.

Is is really slow? How slow it is? Do you know? Make sure you **really really know** how slow things are before
optimizing it, otherwise you wouldn't know if it's any better. And remember, you are stupid, so **don't guess**, write
benchmark or whatever.

**Do not abstract**, unless it's been _20~ish_ time you've wrote same stuff. Even then you should reconsider it. Most of
the times abstractions are simply **wrong** or change so frequently that you were better of without them.

## Do not engineer

Stop pretending that you are an engineer, architect or whatever. **You are not**. You are stupid monkey. Do not invent
things, other less stupid people did everything for you.

- **You need to store data?** use database, don't try to write some in-house solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
- **You need to store files?** use storages, don't try to write some in-house solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
- **You need to integrate external services?** use API wrappers, SDKs, don't try to write some in-house solution to a
  problem that doesn't exist.
- **You need to know that phone number or an email is correct?** send message to it and check if it reached, don't try
  to write some in-house solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

I think you get the gist. Do not solve problems that doesn't exist. Do not look for them. There are no problems, just a
task you need to do. Do it and nothing else.

## No extras

**SOLID**? More like **STUPID**. There's no such thing as clean code, there's no such thing as perfect solution. Only
tradeoffs.

Don't just apply every code style or programming pattern you've learned. It won't work.

### Use default linter and formatter.

If there isn't one, find 3rd-party "default" that is accepted by community.

- For JavaScript/TypeScript it would be prettier and eslint
- For Python stick to default PEP-8
- For Golang use default go fmt

There is no need in **Google Approved Best Recommended Style Guide 9000**. You will only hurt yourself. Rely on them
only if your team already does.

### Write simple stupid and non-pattern code.

You can identify and apply patterns **later**, just don't force them.
Don't try to add _singletons_, _factories_, _commands_, _engines_, _solid_, etc, just because you know them and someone
told you to do.

Your code should work and be **readable**, and **stupid**. Most of the patterns will come naturally as you write it, or
will be obscenely obvious once you're done. If it's not, than it's not the time to add them.

Same thing applies to stupid code. Don't force it's stupidity. **KISS** _(keep it simple, stupid)_ design pattern
doesn't imply that you have to write bad ugly code. Just write naturally as you brain spits ideas on how to complete
your task.

### Write single-threaded blocking code.

You can't possibly write good multi-threaded code. Not at the beginning, and maybe not even later.

Multi-threaded code is **hard**. So hard, in fact, that **async**
exists. And it does for a reason. Just remember, that **async** is actually single-threaded (except for gorutines and
alike, they can and will try to use as many cores as you can give them).

## Use your head

**Your head is empty**. Fill it with some knowledge. Read some articles, watch a video, attend a conference, read a
book.

Don't stop learning, because you are stupid. You can't become smart, but you can be less stupid.

**Learn every day** something new. **Repeat** what you have learned. Make your brain remember it. But don't just
remember.

**Analyze**. Everything that you read, hear or see - **analyze**.

- Is it really the case?
- Should I know it, remember it?
- How can I know if it's true?
- How can I prove it's not?
- What is my opinion on it?
- How does this knowledge impact me?

Use your head daily. Do not rely on others. Do not ask others, they are stupid. You are too, but at least using your own
brain will make you less so.

## Lies, sweet lies

Never ever trust anyone, not me, not even yourself. As I said, we are stupid and **we lie**.

Sometimes we don't even know when we lie. Some may heard a thing on **TV** or from **parents** and believed it's _true_
for the entirety of their lives and now they share it with you. They are your deepest friends, of course they wouldn't
lie, right? **NO!**

They may not understand it, but they can and **will lie** from time to time. **We all do**.

## Say no

Say **no** to every stupid idea you, your collegue or your boss has. It is stupid and you know it.

Don't be afraid to say no to stupid stuff. Accepting it for sake of **"command spirit"** or **"humility"** is just *
*wrong** and will make your life misareble.

I said **stupid** ideas. It doesn't mean you must decline every task you've been assigned. Just make sure that it's not
stupid.

And **don't force it**. If you have to, you have to. IT is a business, stupid business that stupid humans run. Do the
thing if you will lose your job after saying no.

## Outro

Most of the things I wrote actually apply to other things in life. Some may say that some of it not even about
programming, but **it is**.

Humans and human interaction is a **HUGE** part of IT. **Humans** write code that other **Humans** use. **Humans** write
articles about programming and stuff. **Humans** read code, not computer. Computer doesn't **read** code. It scans it
for bits and bytes and stuff.

The most problems in the codebase comes from humans. Improve yourself, improve your skills and remember that **you are
stupid**.

If I forgor something or you think otherwise, do not fret to comment. I am stupid. I lie.

**Thanks!**
