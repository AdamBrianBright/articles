# Tale of Good Code

Published at [dev.to](https://dev.to/adambright/tale-of-good-code-1pdo) on 2025-02-01

## Introduction

People still argue about what "good" code is, as if it weren't an endless kaleidoscope of tastes and opinions, where
every new trend seems revolutionary until it gives way to yet another "innovative" approach.

Good code isn't a set of oft-mentioned buzzwords like "maintainable," "scalable," or "intuitive." It's simply code that
gets the job done: neatly feeding mocks into tests, swiftly and transparently solving the problems posed by business
requirements, and managing not to unleash chaos on tech support.

So what are the criteria? Everything changes as soon as a new requirement, a new framework, or a fresh bug report from
management appears. Readability? For a minute, forget that its assessment is nothing more than a subjective opinion,
similar to the taste of those who, until the very end, argue over what’s better: tabs or spaces. Simplicity? As long as
your code isn’t summoning your GPU to the basement, consider the task done. Maintainability? If a second-shift developer
can at least guess what your code does and why within a week, you’re in the clear.

It’s no wonder that in this endless, disputable debate about quality standards, one might drown. Most people fail to
notice that the main purpose of the code is to meet real-world requirements, not to delight the souls of those who spend
their lives running endless lint marathons and code reviews. If your program works and the client is happy with
it—congratulations, you've already won the Olympic games of genius.

So, esteemed would-be code philosophers, perhaps it's time to stop arguing about trivialities? Let’s instead learn to
understand: good code is not an aesthetically pleasing collection of rules, but, above all, a working tool that works
miracles despite the peculiarities of the world and the whims of business. After all, in the end, it's not magic or art
that matters, but simply a job well done in a timely and quality manner.

## Good Code

### Examples of Describing Good Code

Debates about what constitutes good code have been raging for decades. Various developers have offered their
definitions, and below are the most well-known approaches:

**1. Clean Code — Robert Martin**

In his book *"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"* [^1], Martin emphasizes that good code should be
comprehensible, simple, and easily maintainable. He focuses on principles of readability, simplicity, and the avoidance
of duplication.

**2. SOLID Principles — Robert Martin**

The five SOLID principles [^2] (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation,
Dependency Inversion) help create flexible and maintainable code that can easily adapt to change.

**3. Code That Solves the Problem — Kent Beck**

Kent Beck, in the context of testing and software development, stresses that good code must efficiently address the
tasks at hand, pass tests, and withstand the blows of reality.

**4. Code That Is Easy to Read and Maintain — Martin Fowler**

In his book *"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"* [^3], Fowler highlights the importance of regular
refactoring and creating code that can be modified painlessly.

**5. The DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) — Martin Fowler**

The DRY principle [^4] urges us to avoid code duplication, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors and easing
maintenance.

**6. The KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) — Various Authors**

The KISS principle [^5] dictates that systems should be as simple as possible, and any additional complexity should only
be introduced when absolutely necessary.

### Common Characteristics of Good Code

After analyzing various claims about good code, the following general characteristics can be identified:

1. **Readability**
    - **Clarity:** The code should be comprehensible and "talkative."
    - **Consistency:** Use of uniform styles and naming conventions.
    - **Commenting:** Presence of comments to explain the trickiest parts.
    - **Structure:** Logical organization of code (e.g., through functions and classes).

2. **Simplicity**
    - **Minimalism:** Avoiding unnecessary complexity and superfluous functions.
    - **KISS:** Keeping solutions and architecture simple.
    - **DRY:** Eliminating duplicated code, because repetition is the mother of all errors.

3. **Maintainability**
    - **Modularity:** Code is divided into independent, easily replaceable modules.
    - **Testability:** The ability to easily write tests (e.g., unit tests).
    - **Refactoring:** The potential to improve the structure of code without changing its functionality.

4. **Efficiency**
    - **Performance:** Code optimization for fast execution.
    - **Resource Usage:** Effective use of memory and other resources, without overdoing it.

5. **Security**
    - **Error Handling:** Proper management of exceptions and errors so bugs don’t turn into catastrophes.
    - **Data Protection:** Preventing leaks and unauthorized access to information.

6. **Documentation**
    - **Technical Documentation:** Detailed descriptions of the code’s architecture and usage.
    - **Automated Documentation:** Tools for generating documentation (e.g., godoc).

7. **Standards Compliance**
    - **Coding Standards:** Adherence to widely accepted recommendations (e.g., effective Go [^6]).
    - **Static Analysis:** Using linters to check code quality to make sure bugs don’t get a chance to hide.

### A Detailed Look at Key Characteristics and Why It's All a Bunch of Nonsense

#### 1. Readability

Code readability is a subjective concept; what one programmer finds clear, another might find utterly confusing.
Consider our examples:

```asm
          global    _start

          section   .text
_start:   mov       rax, 1
          mov       rdi, 1
          mov       rsi, message
          mov       rdx, 13
          syscall
          mov       rax, 60
          xor       rdi, rdi
          syscall

          section   .data
message:  db        "Hello, World", 10
```

Assembly code often appears "grainy" and demands deep knowledge of the processor architecture and assembly instructions.
For a specialist used to high-level languages, such code might seem completely unreadable—even if the structure is quite
simple: system calls, register usage, and jumps. Yet for a programmer who regularly works with low-level code, this
style might be entirely familiar.

Now let’s compare it with a Python example:

```python
def f(n):
    return (
        1 if n < 2
        else n * f(n - 1)
        if (lambda x: x % 2 == 0)(n)
        else (lambda x: x * f(x - 1))(n - 1)
    )


def g(x):
    return (
        (lambda y: y + 1)(x)
        if x < 5
        else (lambda y: y - 1)(x)
    )


def h(a):
    return [g(i) for i in range(a)]


print(h(f(5)))
```

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)


def adjust_value(x):
    if x < 5:
        return x + 1
    return x - 1


def generate_adjusted_list(a):
    return [adjust_value(i) for i in range(a)]


result = generate_adjusted_list(factorial(5))
print(result)
```

In the **first example**, the same operations (such as calculating a factorial or adjusting a value) are expressed
through nested ternary operators and lambda functions. This style might appeal to those who value brevity and functional
programming. However, for most developers, such code can be hard to grasp, as the convoluted logic and nested calls make
it difficult to understand the author's intent.

The **second example** is structured much more clearly: functions have meaningful names (factorial, adjust_value,
generate_adjusted_list), and the logic is expressed with usual if/else conditionals. For most programmers, this style
appears more "readable" because it follows the common logic without unnecessary nesting or abstraction.

**The main point:** Readability isn’t so much about following a rigid set of rules (e.g., the AirBnB guidelines for JS)
as it is about how familiar a developer is with the semantic and style of the code. If you're used to reading
functionally compact code with lambdas and ternaries, you might not have any issue with the first example. But if you
prefer the traditional imperative style, where functions and variables have self-explanatory names, the second example
will be much clearer.

**Experience and habit.** What is readable to one programmer might be challenging for another. The context and domain
matter. In some cases, brevity and compactness are key, while in others, clarity and explicit logic division are more
important. Ultimately, the sensible approach is to choose a style not only matching personal preferences but also
meeting the expectations of the people who will maintain and develop the code later. Blindly following guidelines might
lead to code that adheres to some “canon,” but if the team is used to another style, the effect will be the opposite.
There is no universal solution. Readability is a delicate balance between widely accepted practices and the specific
features of a project and team.

#### 2. Simplicity

Simplicity in code is judged not by its appearance but by its clarity. People often confuse a sleek look with internal
complexity. Consider two examples:

```js
const user = db.collection('users').find({
    id: new UUID('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')
});
```

```js
const user = getUsersService().getUserById('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011');
```

**What might be hiding behind a “simple” wrapper?**

1. **Hidden logic and infrastructure.**  
   The function `getUserById` might look like a simple wrapper, but inside it could be handling extremely complex
   processes:
    - **Deduplication of requests.** If several data requests come in simultaneously, the service may group them to
      avoid unnecessary database calls.
    - **Caching.** Before querying the database, the function might check if the needed user is already stored in a fast
      cache, significantly boosting performance.
    - **Permission checks and authorization logic.** The wrapper may automatically verify that the user has permission
      to access the requested data.
    - **Query building and input validation.** Builders and validators that ensure the query is correct might be
      employed here, and their code can be quite voluminous.

2. **Simplicity is a myth.**  
   In the first example, the code directly accesses the `users` collection in the database. At first glance, it seems "
   low-level," simple, and transparent, but it requires the developer to understand the intricacies of database
   interactions, the correct data format (for instance, how exactly a `UUID` should be passed), and manual control of
   all query aspects.

3. **Services and abstractions don’t magically simplify code.**  
   Using a service layer (as in the second example) can hide all the complex logic behind a straightforward and brief
   interface. However, that doesn’t mean the logic itself has become simpler—it’s just encapsulated elsewhere and may
   perform a host of hidden operations critical to the application’s correct functioning.

4. **Comparison and conclusion.**
    - **Simple syntax does not guarantee simple logic.**  
      The `getUserById` wrapper looks much easier to read than a direct database call, but behind that "pretty wrapper"
      there might be a host of mechanisms aimed at improving performance, security, testing convenience, and code
      maintenance.
    - **Only the surface appears simple—not the depth.**  
      Think of it like mythical creatures: unicorns only exist in your damp dreamy fantasies. What the developer sees on
      the surface doesn’t always reveal the full complexity of the underlying processes.
    - **Unicorns?**  
      If you’re still hung up on unicorns, I suggest you take a three-minute or so break from this article and clear
      your cluttered mind of distracting notions.

Ultimately, you must understand that simple code is a myth. There is always another level of abstraction. And, as the
saying goes, any problem can be solved through abstraction—except the abstraction problem itself.

#### 3. Maintainability

Maintainability is, essentially, how much time and nerve it takes to implement changes, adapt the code to new
requirements, fix bugs, or add new features. But let’s break down why the idea of “maintainability” often turns out to
be a myth—a myth cooked up by old, sweaty C++ programmers in their garages, clinging to the idea that code can be easily
changed in the future, even if requirements suddenly do a 180 and hit those morons right in the nuts.

##### Why Maintainability Is a Legend

1. **Constant changes and deadlines**  
   In a world where AGILE processes, meetings, and urgent client requests dictate the rules, developers can spend entire
   days “juggling” new features without even having a chance to ensure the code is architecturally and aesthetically
   perfect.
    - The code changes so quickly that the perfect design conceived at the start becomes obsolete after a couple of
      sprints.

2. **Old architecture versus new requirements**  
   What was considered a convenient solution yesterday may become completely incompatible with the new business needs
   today.
    - Old architectural choices start “falling apart” when new functions are added, and investing in refactoring often
      deals a heavy blow to the schedule.

3. **Quality degradation over time**  
   Rapid changes, often bypassing proper checks, lead to code that was once pristine turning into a developer’s
   nightmare, where fixing one bug triggers a cascade of unforeseen consequences.
    - “Maintainability” becomes a comforting word frequently used when a system, over years of operation, ends up laden
      with half-baked fixes, crutches, and “kludges” (code that no one wants to touch).

4. **Financial losses and legal risks**  
   Neglected code can become a source of vulnerabilities, leading to data leaks, performance drops, and even lawsuits if
   something goes wrong.
    - Neglecting quality for the sake of a quick release can spell disaster for the business.

##### What Really Matters in Practice

Experience shows that instead of striving for the chimera of “maintainability,” it's crucial to have true professionals
who can sift through what others call "horse manure" (a.k.a. code), and even more importantly, know how to say “no” when
a feature or change threatens to destroy everything you’ve been overtime-ing for across the last ten epics. Hail SCRUM
and its creator (no, really)!

- **Programmer skills:**  
  The best asset is the person behind the code—someone who can quickly assess its state and figure out how best to
  improve or modify it. An experienced developer knows that behind “clean” code might hide a bunch of adaptations,
  compromises, and clever tricks, and knows how to work with that. This is far more practical than clinging to
  theoretical maintainability.

- **The role of business analysts and managers:**  
  They often demand changes based on short-term business needs, ignoring the depth and interconnectedness of different
  parts of the system. Here, it’s critical for developers to be able to stand up for technical boundaries and
  convincingly argue why everything shouldn’t be changed “on the fly.” Although sometimes, saving your ass from getting
  fired is the top priority.

Maintainability isn’t a magic button that makes the whole development process easy and painless. It’s a constant
balancing act among business requirements, time, resources, and technical debt. Code, like any complex system, requires
constant attention: refactoring, testing, optimization, and a clear understanding that sometimes you simply must say
“no” to avoid gluing yet another layer onto an already entangled system.

So if you still believe in mythical maintainability, remember: real development strength is the ability to navigate
complexities, see the labyrinth of processes behind the pretty interface, and, when needed, resist the onslaught of
business demands. That is true competence in the programming world.

#### 4. Efficiency

Efficiency and speed of code are important, but often overdoing optimizations is a road to nowhere—especially in
interpreted languages. Let’s go over several points.

##### Micro-Optimizations

If you're writing in JavaScript or, heaven forbid, Python, trying to save a few microseconds on a particular piece of
code is absurd. These languages already have inherent overheads far more significant than your attempts to swap a `for`
loop for a list comprehension. Remember that most of the web request processing time is consumed by database queries.

Even when using compiled and fast languages, such as Go, Rust, or Zig, attempts to speed up the "hot spots" might either
yield negligible gains or, on the contrary, render the code unrecognizable by adding some inexplicable "esotericism"
that ultimately slows down the entire system and future development.

##### Less Code - Less Time

If the goal is for the code to run faster, just write less code! Every extra line, especially if it adds its own
abstractions or overhead, can negatively impact performance. For a more resource-efficient solution, consider choosing
low-level languages where you directly control resources and can achieve maximum optimization for the specific hardware.

No matter what ultra-cool algorithm you use in your project, it will never be faster than its absence. If you can remove
something and still get the same result, you’ve found the optimal efficiency solution.

##### Measure Seven Times, then Go for a Walk Once

Claiming one approach is faster than another without conducting before/after measurements is completely pointless.
Optimization should start with profiling: measure where resources are being spent, and only then decide what and how to
change it.  
Everything must be measured in the context of real conditions: specific hardware, an actual dataset, and defined
business requirements. Without that, any claims of optimality remain speculative.

##### Testing Against Reality

Writing two million lines of Python code and expecting your application to run like "a perfect stallion" is nonsense.  
Optimization only makes sense where it’s truly needed. If the system runs fast enough and its throughput meets
expectations, over-optimizing is just wasted effort—time spent on "optimizations" could be better invested in developing
new features or improving code quality in other areas.

#### 5. Security

Do you really need an explanation? Seriously? Go read **OWASP** [^7] or something...

Security shouldn’t be a selling point of good code. It just needs to be there. Period. If you believe you can achieve
90% secure code and enjoy that, please step into this chamber. Something smells fishy? Don’t worry, we haven’t received
a single negative review yet.

#### 6. Documentation

Documentation is undoubtedly important, but it doesn’t compensate for the lack of good code. You can document every
nuance. But let a new developer read the most detailed documentation—even if each method or function has a comprehensive
description—if upon opening the first file they see raccoons rummaging through a trash can, no amount of comments or
instructions can fix that.

> Perfect but outdated documentation is an even bigger nightmare than having none at all.

##### Key Points:

1. **Code Comes First.**  
   Documentation is like a navigational map. But if the terrain (the code) looks like ruins, even the most detailed map
   won’t help you figure out how to get to your destination.
    - If the code is well-structured, readable, and logically divided into modules, the documentation becomes merely a
      pleasant bonus.
    - If the code itself is a jumbled mess of hacks and chaos, the documentation can only highlight that contrast.

2. **Documentation Relevance.**  
   You need to document everything, but if the documentation isn’t updated alongside code changes, it loses its value.
    - Constantly updating documentation is as vital as maintaining the code itself.
    - Perfect documentation isn’t a static artifact—it’s a living entity that evolves with the product.

3. **Code is the Project’s Face.**  
   When a new developer starts exploring a project, the first thing they look at is the code.  
   If they find strangeness there, their trust in the project will wane, even if every method or function is accompanied
   by a detailed explanation.
    - Good code should "speak for itself."
    - Documentation should serve as a helpful tool, not a way to cover up architectural or implementation shortcomings.

##### Conclusion:

Documentation is an important component that helps you understand how the system works, but it by itself does not make
code good. Ideal comments and detailed descriptions cannot mask chaos in the source code.

In the end, if you ensure that documentation reflects the state of the program and that the code is clear and logical,
you are creating a truly quality product. But if your code looks like a tangle of unorganized text and hacks, no amount
of detailed commentary will change the bitter truth.

#### 7. Standards

Standards indeed play an important role—they help minimize internal team disputes, ensure a basic level of uniformity,
and simplify the integration of various components. However, standards on their own are far from perfect:

1. **Standards Are Never Ideal.**  
   Just look at how many data exchange protocols, cable connectors, and various JavaScript libraries exist today. Every
   standard, be it an established practice or a modern trend, has its limitations and can’t satisfy absolutely every
   need of different teams and projects.

2. **Rigid Adherence to Standards.**  
   By following any given standard, you can significantly reduce debates, even if not everyone loves it unconditionally.
   But in doing so, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to express a creative approach or implement something new if
   the standard doesn’t consider your realities.

3. **A Compromise-Based Approach.**  
   The ideal is not blind adherence to a standard, but a conscious choice: use it to reduce conflicts, yet remember that
   sometimes you can and should suggest improvements. No one is saying you must be dogmatic or reject everything new.
   The key is to maintain a balance between the compromises necessary for teamwork and the critical thinking needed to
   improve processes.

4. **Emphasis on Constructive Change.**  
   In reality, adhering to standards isn’t the ultimate goal—it’s a way to simplify communication. If a standard doesn’t
   meet your needs, think about adapting it. Yes, this might lead to further debates, but through constructive disputes
   and experiments, innovative approaches are born.

Follow standards if they help your team work together, but don’t expect them to magically make your code perfect.
Standards are merely tools to ease communication and maintain a unified style. They cannot replace common sense,
professionalism, and the desire to constantly improve your solutions. Remember: when a standard begins to hinder
development, it might be high time to give a little "kick" to those who set it—in spite of the fact that you might have
been its initiator.
